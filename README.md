##🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for design & animations

JavaScript (ES6) for sorting logic & interactivity


##🧮 Bubble Sort Algorithm

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
The largest element “bubbles up” to the end of the array in each pass.

🔑 Pseudocode:
for i = 0 to n-1
    for j = 0 to n-i-1
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])


Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n) (when already sorted)

Average Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)
