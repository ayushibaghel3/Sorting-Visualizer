<h3>🛠️ Tech Stack</h3>

HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for design & animations

JavaScript (ES6) for sorting logic & interactivity


<h3>🧮 Bubble Sort Algorithm</h3>

Bubble Sort works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
The largest element “bubbles up” to the end of the array in each pass.

<b>🔑 Pseudocode: </b>
for i = 0 to n-1
    for j = 0 to n-i-1
        if arr[j] > arr[j+1]
            swap(arr[j], arr[j+1])


<b>Time Complexity:</b>

Best Case: O(n) (when already sorted)

Average Case: O(n²)

Worst Case: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)
